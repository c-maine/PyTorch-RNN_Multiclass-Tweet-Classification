# PyTorch-RNN_Multiclass-Tweet-Classification
Sentiment Analysis of Hate Speech using PyTorch RNN

**Overview and Scope**

Objective: Our initial objective was to build an RNN capable of performing a binary classification of tweets containing offensive language vs. those that do not contain offensive language and experiment with the objective function, number of layers and layer size in order to improve model performance. As an extension, we also created an RNN capable of performing a multi-class model capable of predicting three classes - hate speech, offensive language and neither.
